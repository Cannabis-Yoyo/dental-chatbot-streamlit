    }
  },
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What causes tooth sensitivity?",
      "answer": "Tooth sensitivity is commonly caused by exposure of dentin due to enamel erosion, gum recession exposing the root surface, cracked teeth, or recent dental procedures. Management includes desensitizing toothpaste, fluoride treatments, bonding agents, or addressing the underlying cause (restoration or gum treatment)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I get a dental cleaning?",
      "answer": "Most patients benefit from a professional cleaning every 6 months. However, patients with periodontal disease or high risk of cavities may need hygiene visits every 3–4 months. Your dentist will recommend a personalized schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is a dental crown painful?",
      "answer": "The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, so you should not feel pain during the tooth preparation. Mild soreness or sensitivity can occur after the anesthetic wears off, but this typically resolves within a few days and is manageable with over-the-counter pain relief."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a dental implant last?",
      "answer": "With good oral hygiene, proper maintenance, and regular dental visits, dental implants can last decades and often a lifetime. Success depends on factors like bone quality, smoking, systemic health, and hygiene."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a crown be done in one visit?",
      "answer": "Yes, some clinics use same-day CAD/CAM systems (e.g., CEREC) to design, mill, and place a crown in a single appointment. Otherwise, traditional crowns typically require two visits with a temporary crown placed in between."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do if my crown falls off?",
      "answer": "Keep the crown if possible, keep the area clean, and contact your dentist promptly. Avoid chewing on that side. Temporary dental cement available at pharmacies can be used as a short-term measure until you see your dentist."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are dental X-rays safe?",
      "answer": "Modern dental X-rays use very low radiation doses and are generally considered safe. Protective lead aprons and thyroid collars are used when appropriate. The diagnostic benefit usually outweighs the minimal radiation risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prepare for a dental implant consultation?",
      "answer": "Bring a list of your medical history, current medications, previous dental records if available, and any recent dental X-rays. Expect a clinical exam and imaging (periapical or cone-beam CT) to assess bone volume and plan treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is peri-implantitis?",
      "answer": "Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the soft and hard tissues around a dental implant, often caused by bacterial plaque. It can lead to bone loss and implant failure if not treated. Good hygiene and regular maintenance reduce risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my insurance cover implants or crowns?",
      "answer": "Coverage varies widely by insurer and plan. Many dental insurance policies cover a portion of crown or implant-related costs, but often with limitations. Check with your insurance provider or our clinic staff for pre-treatment estimates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get dental treatment during pregnancy?",
      "answer": "Routine dental care and urgent treatment are generally safe during pregnancy, especially after the first trimester. Elective procedures are often postponed until after delivery. Always inform the dentist about your pregnancy and consult your physician if needed."
